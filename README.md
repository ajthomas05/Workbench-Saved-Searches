# Workbench-Saved-Searches

Although you can bookmark Workbench queries as of recent(ish), I found that having a manager in the browser window was much more effecient. This simply uses localStorage and the current URL to save a query (after running), and upon clicking, redirects to that query.

This is a userscript to be used with Tampermonkey browser plugin. Only tested on Chrome so far.
